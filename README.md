# Forth in Javascript
## Why?
I hear you ask why, which is hardly surprising. 
* Forth was the first language I got good at
* Javascript is the language I like to play in now
* You can run it in any browser, and on a server, and on some embedded devices
* If its modular enough I should be able to replace the JS with C, C++, Wasm or Assembler.
* All the Forth I've seen has been really antiquated, or over-complex, needs a fresh approach

## Status 

node forth_v1.js should load and run some tests

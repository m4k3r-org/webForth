# FORTH language and links

Forth is an odd language, but if you are here the chances are you know that. 
There are also not many people using it, and the ANSI standard is pretty poor 
(for example it doesn't appear to define counted strings).

These are the links I found useful developing this. 
* https://www.taygeta.com/forth/ is a 1994 draft of the ANSI spec which is apparantly 
the same as the final version.
* http://forth.org/ Forth Interest Group - now defunct 
* https://www.forth.com/ Forth Inc - 
* 1013_eForthAndZen.pdf - eForth, I'm going to switch to this version

And some links I have still to research.

Some github projects (maybe) of note
* https://github.com/larsbrinkhoff/lbForth - seems to have a lot of code, cross compiler etc
* https://github.com/philburk/pforth/blob/master/fth/strings.fth
* https://github.com/zeroflag/punyforth ESP forth-like
* https://github.com/ForthHub/forth Forth in JS as node module
* One of the other git - search for forth - look for javascript tag repos had javascript interoperability code
* https://github.com/marianoguerra/ricardo-forth compiles to wasm, but via C so probably loses efficiency
* https://github.com/drom/wast-forth wast > Forth
